Meeting Transcript - Q4 Project Review
Date: September 21, 2025
Participants: Sarah Johnson (Project Manager), Mike Chen (Senior Developer), Lisa Martinez (UX Designer), David Brown (Business Analyst)

Sarah: Good morning everyone, let's start our Q4 project review. We need to discuss the website redesign progress and address some critical issues.

Mike: Thanks Sarah. I've completed the backend API integration and the database optimization. However, we're facing some performance issues with the new search functionality.

Lisa: The user interface is 80% complete. I've finished the mobile responsive design and the new dashboard layout. The client feedback has been positive so far.

David: I've analyzed the user requirements and we need to prioritize the payment integration feature. The client specifically mentioned this as critical for their Q4 launch.

Sarah: That's a good point David. Mike, can you estimate how long the payment integration will take?

Mike: I'd say about 2-3 weeks for the full implementation. We need to integrate with Stripe and handle the security requirements.

Lisa: I can have the payment UI mockups ready by next Friday. We should also consider adding a progress indicator for the checkout process.

David: The client also wants us to implement the analytics dashboard we discussed last week. This is high priority.

Sarah: Let's create a task list. Mike, you'll handle the payment integration. Lisa, work on the analytics dashboard UI. David, prepare the requirements document for the new features.

Mike: I'll start on the payment integration immediately. I should have a working prototype by next Tuesday.

Lisa: I'll create wireframes for the analytics dashboard and get your feedback before proceeding.

David: I'll have the requirements document ready by Wednesday. Should I schedule a follow-up meeting with the client?

Sarah: Yes, let's schedule it for next Friday. We need to present our progress and get approval for the additional features.

Mike: Sounds good. I'll also look into the performance issues with the search functionality. It might be a database indexing problem.

Lisa: I'll test the mobile responsiveness on different devices this week and fix any issues.

David: I'll prepare a cost estimate for the additional features and present it to the client.

Sarah: Perfect. Let's reconvene next Friday at 2 PM. Everyone please update the project tracker by end of day.

Meeting adjourned at 10:30 AM.
